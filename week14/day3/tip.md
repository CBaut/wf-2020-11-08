# Ask questions

- My first interview was schedule for 2 hrs
- I stayed there for 4 hrs because I had more questions for them, then they had for me
- I got the job
- Having questions about the company or the work they do, shows your interest
- search for anything you are curious about
- 20 minute rule (looks stuff up yourself)
- batch questions (aimed toward understanding)
- not asking questions can lead to mistakes or errors in judgement
